# angular-debounce-throttle

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/user/angular-debounce-throttle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/user/angular-debounce-throttle)


## Installation

Install with [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install --save angular-debounce-throttle
```


## API

### angular-debounce-throttle()


## Testing

Install [Node](http://nodejs.org) (comes with npm) and Bower.

From the repo root, install the project's development dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Testing relies on the Karma test-runner. If you'd like to use Karma to
automatically watch and re-run the test file during development, it's easiest
to globally install Karma and run it from the CLI.

```
npm install -g karma
karma start
```

To run the tests in Firefox, just once, as CI would:

```
npm test
```


## Browser support

* Google Chrome (latest)
